============
Installation
============

Pygments requires at least Python 2.3 to work correctly. Just to clarify:
there *won't* ever be support for Python versions below 2.3.


Install the release version
===========================

1.  download the recent tarball from the `download page`_
2.  unpack the tarball
3.  ``sudo python setup.py install``

Note that the last command will automatically download and install
`setuptools`_ if you don't already have it installed. This requires a working
internet connection.

This will install Pygments into your Python installation's site-packages directory.


Install via easy_install
========================

You can also install the most recent Pygments version using `easy_install`_::

    sudo easy_install Pygments

This will install a Pygments egg in your Python installation's site-packages
directory.


Installing the development version
==================================

1.  Install `Subversion`_
2.  ``svn co http://trac.pocoo.org/repos/pygments/trunk pygments``
3.  ``cd pygments``
4.  ``ln -s pygments /usr/lib/python2.X/site-packages``
5.  ``ln -s pygmentize /usr/local/bin``

As an alternative to steps 4 and 5 you can also do ``python setup.py develop``
which will install the package via setuptools in development mode.
