Pygments changelog
==================

Version 0.7 (in development)
----------------------------
(codename Faschingskrapfn, released Feb 13, 2007)

- Changed the exception raised if no suitable lexer, formatter etc. is
  found in one of the `get_*_by_*` functions to a custom exception,
  `pygments.util.ClassNotFound`. It is, however, a subclass of `ValueError`
  in order to retain backwards compatibility.

- Added a `-H` command line option which can be used to get the docstring
  of a lexer, formatter or filter.

- Made the handling of lexers and formatters more consistent. The aliases
  and filename patterns of formatters are now attributes on them. 

- Added an OCaml lexer, thanks to Adam Blinkinsop.

- Made the HTML formatter more flexible, and easily subclassable in order
  to make it easy to implement custom wrappers, e.g. alternate line
  number markup. See the documentation.

- Added an `outencoding` option to all formatters, making it possible
  to override the `encoding` (which is used by lexers and formatters) when
  using the command line interface. Also, if using the terminal formatter
  and the output file is a terminal and has an encoding attribute, use it
  if no encoding is given.

- Made it possible to just drop style modules into the `styles` subpackage
  of the Pygments installation.

- Added a "state" keyword argument to the `using` helper.

- Added a `commandprefix` option to the `LatexFormatter` which allows to
  control how the command names are constructed.

- Added quite a few new lexers, thanks to Tim Hatch:

  * Java Server Pages
  * Windows batch files
  * Trac Wiki markup
  * Python tracebacks
  * ReStructuredText
  * Dylan
  * and the Befunge esoteric programming language (yay!)

- Added Mako lexers by Ben Bangert.

- Added "fruity" style, another dark background originally vim-based theme.

- Added sources.list lexer by Dennis Kaarsemaker.

- Added token stream filters, and a pygmentize option to use them.

- Changed behavior of `in` Operator for tokens. 

- Added mimetypes for all lexers.

- Fixed some problems lexing Python strings.

- Fixed tickets: #167, #178, #179, #180, #185, #201.

- Added some functions to iterate over existing lexers, formatters
  and lexers.

- The HtmlFormatter's `get_style_defs()` can now take a list as an
  argument to generate CSS with multiple prefixes.

- Support for guessing input encoding added.

- Encoding support added: all processing is now done with Unicode
  strings, input and output are converted from and optionally to
  byte strings (see the ``encoding`` option of lexers and formatters).

  continuations.
